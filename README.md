# zama-protocol

The missing knowledge between AI agents and production encrypted smart contracts.

Built on [Zama's FHEVM](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol) — Fully Homomorphic Encryption on EVM-compatible blockchains.

## What is this?

A Claude Code plugin containing three skills that teach AI agents (and developers) how to build confidential dApps with FHEVM. Fills verified LLM blind spots — things stock models get wrong about encrypted smart contracts.

| Skill | What it covers |
|-------|---------------|
| **zama-protocol** | FHE concepts, protocol architecture, planning, verified addresses, universal gotchas |
| **zama-solidity** | Encrypted Solidity — FHE types, ACL, ERC-7984, Foundry/Hardhat setup |
| **zama-typescript** | TypeScript SDK — React, browser, Node.js, MV3, token flows, sessions |

## Install

Inside any Claude Code session, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add zama-ai/skills
/plugin install zama-protocol@zama-skills
```

All three skills install together. They trigger automatically based on context — protocol questions load `zama-protocol`, Solidity work loads `zama-solidity`, TypeScript/SDK work loads `zama-typescript`.

To pull updates later, run `/plugin marketplace update zama-skills`.

## What AI Agents Get Wrong About FHE

1. **You cannot branch on encrypted values.** `if (FHE.gt(a, b))` does not compile. Use `FHE.select()`.
2. **ACL is mandatory.** Every encrypted value needs `FHE.allowThis()` + `FHE.allow()` after storage. Miss one and the value silently becomes unusable.
3. **`euint64` is the default for balances, not `euint256`.** Larger types cost more gas for every operation.
4. **Division only works with plaintext divisors.** `FHE.div(a, encryptedB)` does not exist.
5. **Random bounds must be powers of 2.** `FHE.randEuint8(100)` is wrong — use `FHE.randEuint8(128)`.
6. **Trivial encryption is not secure.** `FHE.asEuint64(42)` is visible onchain. Only `FHE.fromExternal()` with user-submitted inputs is truly private.
7. **FHE operations are not `view` functions.** They cost gas. Every encrypted add, multiply, or compare is state-changing.
