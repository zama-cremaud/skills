description: Write confidential Solidity smart contracts on Zama's FHEVM. Use when the user is writing, reviewing, or debugging encrypted Solidity — FHE types (euint64, ebool), ACL (FHE.allowThis/allow), FHE.select, ERC-7984 confidential tokens, ZamaEthereumConfig, `@fhevm/solidity`, `@openzeppelin/confidential-contracts`, Foundry or Hardhat setup for FHEVM, or any Solidity code that uses the FHE library.

# Zama Solidity — Confidential Smart Contracts

Encrypted Solidity on FHEVM. This skill covers contract patterns, FHE operations, ACL, ERC-7984 tokens, and project setup.

**Before writing any code:** load the **zama-protocol** skill and read the universal gotchas — they cover the protocol-level bugs that apply to all FHEVM work (branching on encrypted values, ACL semantics, trivial encryption, HCU costs, decryption flow). What follows here is Solidity-specific.

## Solidity-specific reminders

These supplement the universal gotchas in the zama-protocol skill.

- **Inherit `ZamaEthereumConfig` first.** It sets the FHEVM coprocessor addresses (`ACL`, `FHEVMExecutor`, `KMSVerifier`) per `block.chainid`. Without it, those addresses default to `address(0)` and every FHE op reverts the moment it tries to call them — with no revert reason, because the EVM is calling an empty account. Confusing to debug if you don't know to look for it.

- **Use ERC-7984 for any confidential token.** Never reimplement encrypted balances, allowances, or transfers. `@openzeppelin/confidential-contracts` has the audited implementation. See `references/erc7984.md`.

- **ACL after every state update.** `FHE.allowThis(handle)` for the contract, `FHE.allow(handle, user)` for decrypt access. ERC-7984 handles this internally; only hand-written FHE code needs it. For single-tx cross-contract handles, prefer `FHE.allowTransient` over persistent `FHE.allow`.

- **`FHE.select` branches must be encrypted values.** Both arms must be the same encrypted type — materialise zeros with `FHE.asEuint64(0)`, not a literal `0`. Both branches always execute.

- **Silent failures on insufficient balance.** FHE contracts transfer 0 via `FHE.select` — no revert. Test the zero-transfer case and call every function twice to prove ACL persistence.

- **`via_ir` is a `solc` setting, not a build-tool requirement.** Both Foundry and Hardhat call the same compiler. The official templates (`fhevm-foundry-template`, `fhevm-hardhat-template`) compile FHE contracts without IR — start from them. If `solc` reports "stack too deep" on your own contracts, enable IR (`via_ir = true` in Foundry, `viaIR: true` in Hardhat). Don't enable it preemptively as a cargo-cult based on older Zama docs.

- **`FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable(handle)` after every update** to a publicly-decryptable state variable.

- **Decryption helpers are test-only.** `decrypt`, `userDecrypt`, etc. don't exist on production `FHE.sol`. Make decryption the last step — no conditional actions after.
