# SDK permissions and sessions

Use this note for session signatures, decrypt authorization, delegation, and session teardown.

Do not describe this as "credentials" unless quoting an existing API name. The user-facing concept is session authorization.

## Session model in one sentence

The SDK needs a wallet signature to authorize decrypt access for specific contracts; check it with `isAllowed` / `useIsAllowed`, request it with `allow` / `useAllow`, and avoid triggering it invisibly.

## Main APIs

### Session authorization

- Core SDK: `allow`, `isAllowed`, `revoke`, `revokeSession`
- React SDK: `useAllow`, `useIsAllowed`, `useRevoke`, `useRevokeSession`

Use this for user-owned decrypt flows such as balance reads or custom-contract outputs.

### Delegation

- Core SDK: `delegateDecryption`, `revokeDelegation`, `delegationStatus`, `decryptBalanceAs`, `batchDecryptBalancesAs`
- React hooks: `useDelegateDecryption`, `useRevokeDelegation`, `useDecryptBalanceAs`, `useDelegationStatus`

Use delegation when another address or service needs permission to decrypt on behalf of a user.

## Practical rules

- Check permission before a decrypting read.
- If missing, show an explicit button and call `allow`.
- Pass query `enabled` flags so decrypting queries do not prompt on render.
- Signer lifecycle subscriptions can revoke sessions on disconnect or account change, so manual teardown is not always necessary.
- Use `useRevokeSession` for sign-out/security-reset flows, not after every operation.

## TTL rules

- `sessionTTL` controls how long the wallet signature remains valid.
- Short TTLs produce more prompts but reduce exposure.
- Long or infinite TTLs improve UX but should be a conscious product decision.
- Do not simulate short TTLs by revoking after every balance read; that creates bad UX and repeated wallet prompts.

## Scope rules

- Scope permissions to the exact contract addresses needed.
- For custom FHE contracts, the decrypt handle's `contractAddress` must match the producing contract.
- For token flows, pair this note with `sdk-token-flows.md` because wrapper/token addresses matter.
