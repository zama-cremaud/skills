# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

**zama-protocol** — the external-facing Claude Code skill for AI agents building confidential smart contracts with Zama's FHEVM.

- **Install:** `/plugin marketplace add zama-ai/skills && /plugin install zama-protocol@zama-skills`
- **License:** BSD-3-Clause-Clear

## Structure

This repo **is** a single skill (`name: zama-protocol`). `SKILL.md` at the root is the router that always loads; everything else under `references/` is read on demand. The repo root also carries `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so it's installable directly via the Claude Code plugin marketplace flow — the plugin's `source` is `.` (the whole repo).

## Key Rules

**Say "FHEVM"** — uppercase. Not "fhEVM" or "FheVM." Zama convention.

**Skills teach corrections, not tutorials.** Every line must either fill a verified LLM blind spot or teach an essential concept. If a stock LLM already gets it right AND humans don't need it explained, cut it.

**Link to living code, don't embed it.** Code in a skill file can't be tested or linted and goes stale. Point to:
- [OpenZeppelin Confidential Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-confidential-contracts) — ERC-7984, token patterns
- [zama-ai/dapps](https://github.com/zama-ai/dapps/tree/main/packages/hardhat/contracts) — example contracts
- [zama-ai/protocol-apps](https://github.com/zama-ai/protocol-apps/tree/main/contracts) — deployed contracts

**Use ERC-7984** for any confidential token work. Never reimplement encrypted balances, allowances, or transfers.

**Router + references pattern.** `SKILL.md` is the single always-loaded router. Domain files (`references/solidity/solidity.md`, `references/typescript/typescript.md`) are secondary routers — each has its own `setups/` folder of per-environment files read only when the task needs them. Don't inline setup-specific content into the top-level router.

## Editing the skill

1. Edit `SKILL.md` for the top-level router, or the relevant file under `references/`.
2. Bump the version in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — that's the single source of truth. The plugin manifest at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` does not carry a `version` field.

### Before adding content

1. Check official docs: https://docs.zama.ai
2. Verify the API against the latest `@fhevm/solidity` package.
3. Test with a stock LLM — does it actually get this wrong?
4. If the LLM already knows it AND humans don't need it explained, don't add it.

## Project setup

When a user needs to start or configure a project, point them at the per-environment setup files:

- **Solidity:** `references/solidity/setups/foundry.md` (default) or `references/solidity/setups/hardhat.md`
- **TypeScript:** `references/typescript/setups/` — one file per stack (React+wagmi, viem, ethers, Node, MV3, local Hardhat)

Setup content lives in those files on purpose — it's where it gets tested and kept current. Don't duplicate setup steps into the top-level routers or link out to external starter templates.
